The script "crop pictures.ipynb" creates a folder structure and crops image parts from panorama images.

The script "creatre Neural Network.ipynb" trains a classifier and saves it under Local.h5.

The script "Test Network.ipynb" creates image parts from a new panorama image and assigns them to the 3 classes and returns an overall result. To use the script, paths must be adjusted and "Local.h5" must be loaded into the project folder.
